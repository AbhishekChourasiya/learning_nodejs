This is a simple demonstration of making http calls (e.g get, put, post ) and handling that request using node.js app.

This application also uses <b>Express.js</b> to efficiently handle the request and <b> Joi package </b> to do input validation of request. 
We're also using <b>body-parser</b> to extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body as something easier to interface with.
